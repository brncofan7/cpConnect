        We have helping individuals promote balance, growth, and health in Christ-centered lifestyles:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financially</strong><br />Several passages in scripture encourage us to be good stewards of our earthly wealth. Center Point Church strongly encourages thoughtful financial stewardship (management) in life.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationally</strong><br />Center Point Church strongly emphasizes the importance of deeply committed family life and strong, healthy relationships with others.</li>
        <li><strong>Educationally</strong><br />As a part of a balanced life, we value and encourage education, and continued personal growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Physically</strong><br />Center Point Church believes that the physical aspect of our lives is important. We emphasize health consciousness, and discourage practices that destroy our bodies.</li>
        <li><strong>Spiritually</strong><br />Jesus grew in favor with God. Jesus knew the importance of keeping his spiritual life on track through prayer, fasting, scripture reading, and spending time in the synagogue. This, of course, is our central concern at Center Point Church.</li>
