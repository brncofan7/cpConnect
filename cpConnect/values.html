    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>People</strong></span><br />
    We value people of all ages as the reason for the churches existence.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Teamwork</strong></span><br />
    We value a culture that embraces teamwork. We are passionate about creating a place for everyone to be involved and use their talents for one common goal.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Excellence</span></strong><br />
    We value excellence in who we are and all that we do.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Diversity</span></strong><br />
    We value diversity in age, gender, culture, and race.</p>
    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 16px;">Relevance</span></strong><br />
    We value presenting an unchanging message to a changing culture. We desire to relate to our society and present the gospel in a relevant, attractive , contagious environment.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Loyalty</strong></span><br />
    We value loyalty to God, a Christ-centered lifestyle, to others, to the house, and to commitments.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Positive Culture</strong></span><br />
    We value a church that has a positive, uplifting, and welcoming atmosphere. We embrace positive attitudes, faith-filled optimism, and an attractive, contagious environment.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>Balance and Growth</strong></span><br />
    We have helping individuals promote balance, growth, and health in Christ-centered lifestyles:</p>
    <ul class="list separator bullet-blue">
        <li><strong>Financially</strong><br />Several passages in scripture encourage us to be good stewards of our earthly wealth. Center Point Church strongly encourages thoughtful financial stewardship (management) in life.</li>
        <li><strong>Relationally</strong><br />Center Point Church strongly emphasizes the importance of deeply committed family life and strong, healthy relationships with others.</li>
        <li><strong>Educationally</strong><br />As a part of a balanced life, we value and encourage education, and continued personal growth.</li>
        <li><strong>Physically</strong><br />Center Point Church believes that the physical aspect of our lives is important. We emphasize health consciousness, and discourage practices that destroy our bodies.</li>
        <li><strong>Spiritually</strong><br />Jesus grew in favor with God. Jesus knew the importance of keeping his spiritual life on track through prayer, fasting, scripture reading, and spending time in the synagogue. This, of course, is our central concern at Center Point Church.</li>
    </ul>
